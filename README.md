# [DevKDesigns.com](http://devkdesigns.com) Puppet Manifests

A set of manifests for a standalone Puppet install.

1. `scp -r puppet devkdesigns.com:`
2. `sudo apt-get install puppet && puppet apply --modulepath=puppet/modules puppet/manifests/base.pp`
3. Return in six months after learning more about Puppet; hang head in shame.
